# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
# Amazon Clone

This project is a clone of the Amazon website built using React. It aims to mimic the functionality and design of the original Amazon website, providing a platform where users can browse products, add them to a cart, and proceed to checkout.
- Add to cart functionality
- Checkout process
- Responsive design
